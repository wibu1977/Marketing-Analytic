Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a company’s customer base, revealing key insights that can be leveraged to enhance business strategies and drive growth. The analysis covers various aspects of the customer profile, including income, education, marital status, and purchasing behavior.

Key Findings
The average income of the customers is approximately $42,000.
A significant portion of the customers are well-educated, with 50.3% being graduates and 21.7% holding a PhD degree.
The marital status distribution shows that 38.6% of customers are divorced, 25.9% are single, and 21.4% are married.
Among married customers, 46% have one child, 2.3% have two children, and 51.7% do not have any children yet.
The most popular products among the customers are wines and meats.
Customers prefer to make purchases in stores and through the company’s website.
There is a negative correlation between the number of web visits and the number of web purchases. However, the number of web visits is positively correlated with the number of deals purchased.
The fourth campaign was the most successful.
Spain emerged as the biggest market for the company.
Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following strategies are recommended to enhance customer engagement and increase sales:

Highlight the premium quality and variety of the company’s products, especially wines and meats, which are the top-selling items.
Enhance the shopping experience across physical stores and the company’s website by providing personalized recommendations based on customers’ preferences and purchasing history.
Incentivize purchases by offering special promotions, discounts, and loyalty rewards. Create limited-time offers and exclusive deals targeting specific customer segments such as singles, families, and high-income individuals.
Develop engaging and informative content related to food, wine pairings, cooking tips, and the benefits of the company’s products.
Capitalize on the success in the Spanish market and expand to other regions with similar demographics and preferences. Adapt the campaign to resonate with local cultures and traditions while maintaining the company’s brand identity and values.
These strategies aim to create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience for the customers, ultimately driving customer loyalty and increasing sales.
